BlogCFCCompat
=============

Makes ContentBox still obey BlogCFC SES routes to keep old links alive.

To install, drop the folder into your modules directory.  Better yet, install it straight from ForgeBox inside your ContentBox admin.

Adds routes for the following URL patterns.

* http://www.example.com/2013
* http://www.example.com/2013/7
* http://www.example.com/2013/7/4
* http://www.example.com/2013/7/4/why-i-love-independance-day
* http://www.example.com/CategoryName
